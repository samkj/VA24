The SPÖ also slipped.

Lower Austria is Austria's largest province in terms of area. The provincial election is seen as a test of mood for the entire country. And in fact, three things can already be said:

Never has the ÖVP performed so badly.

Never has the result of the SPÖ been so bad.

Never has the right-wing FPÖ been so strong.

At the moment, only 48 percent of the votes have been counted; urban areas are still missing. But one thing is already certain: the fall of the ÖVP in Lower Austria is historic. The absolute majority in the state parliament is gone, as is the majority in the proportional representation state government. A personnel debate about party leader and chancellor Karl Nehammer may soon follow. In the maltreated SPÖ, a personnel debate about the party leader would also be possible.

According to the ORF/Sora projections, 39.7 percent went to the governing ÖVP party, which thus lost 9.9 percent and six seats in the state parliament. The right-wing populist FPÖ is making significant gains and, according to the first projection, is in second place with 25.0 percent of the vote and 14 mandates (+6). The social democratic SPÖ receives 21.0 percent (-3.0) of the vote and thus lands in third place.

In its election campaign, the FPÖ had criticized the federal government for the increase in the number of asylum seekers and for the Russia sanctions, which in the FPÖ's view had triggered the inflation. In nationwide polls, the FPÖ had been in first place for weeks, followed by the Social Democrats (SPÖ), also in opposition. The conservative chancellor's party ÖVP had recently been on the defensive at the state and federal level because of corruption investigations and the wave of inflation.

On Sunday, 1.3 million people in Lower Austria were called to cast their votes. A poll commissioned by broadcaster ORF showed that the policies of the federal government play an important role for more than half of the voters. Inflation, the environment and climate, as well as asylum and immigration were cited as the most important political issues for the election decision.",52,2023-01-29 17:13:04,1,ÖVP,europe,,Big gains for the rightwing FP around ten percentage points down for the conservative VP the state election Lower Austria is a disaster for Chancellor Nehammer The SP slipped Lower Austria is Austrias largest province terms of area The provincial election is seen as a test of mood for the entire country And fact three things can already be said Never has the VP performed badly Never has the result of the SP been bad Never has the rightwing FP been strong At the moment only percent of the votes have been counted urban areas are still missing But one thing is already certain the fall of the VP Lower Austria is historic The absolute majority the state parliament is gone as is the majority the proportional representation state government A personnel debate about party leader and chancellor Karl Nehammer may soon follow the maltreated SP a personnel debate about the party leader would be possible According to the ORFSora projections percent went to the governing VP party which thus lost percent and six seats the state parliament The rightwing populist FP is making significant gains and according to the first projection is second place with percent of the vote and mandates The social democratic SP receives percent of the vote and thus lands third place its election campaign the FP had criticized the federal government for the increase the number of asylum seekers and for the Russia sanctions which the FPs view had triggered the inflation nationwide polls the FP had been first place for weeks followed by the Social Democrats SP opposition The conservative chancellors party VP had recently been on the defensive at the state and federal level because of corruption investigations and the wave of inflation On Sunday million people Lower Austria were called to cast their votes A poll commissioned by broadcaster ORF showed that the policies of the federal government play important role for more than half of the voters Inflation the environment and climate as well as asylum and immigration were cited as the most important political issues for the election decision,POSITIVE,0.3852500021457672,2.614749997854233

and the FPÖ is doing the same, when easy solutions don't work than because someone else is still preventing the solution form happening

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options:

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP.

Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

That's a different tune to a few months ago where he said it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Meaning they will put all the blame on former FPÖ leader Strache who was at the center of the scandal (and a few more scandals that came out recently). Now that he's gone they can pretend that all is fine again.

The only thing that can come between them is that Kurz vowed to not have anything to do with Kickl, the ugly face of the FPÖ, ever again, but it seems like they will insist on him. We'll see who caves first.

*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile.

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

It was likely that both fpö and spö get 20+% so the ÖVP can do what they want anyway. It also looks like Neos+Green are another option but i don't know what to think of that.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend.

They'd at the same time permanently replace the SPÖ with the Greens as the legitimate left alternative in the eyes of many, and at the same time take them into an even stronger bourgeois, middle-class direction. There's already an interesting dynamic where the ÖVP and Greens often fish in the same waters (middle-class), as do SPÖ and FPÖ (working class).

That being said, from a policy perspective, a Black-Green government is even more difficult than a Black-Red one. What's program supposed to be?

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

people who dont vote for him do it for different reasons The party is pretty skeptical about measures to fight climate change often suggests that the EU should do more but then the EVP votes against any measures for climate change too They dont care for employees rights that much they legalized working up to hours per week they gave companies much more say about social insurances representative organizations of companies and employees lead the social insurances Austria and they gave the companies more weight VP is for more surveillance and more rights for the police without requiring the permission of a judge They vote against more transparency of the state every time Austria still has the Amtsgeheimnis which means most actions of any government office are not transparent to the public There are many subventions for questionable projects which the public knows nothing about They are pretty conservative overall eg regarding gay rights and drug

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options:

It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

Ibiza enquiry ends early - and puts Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in the dock
Austria's parliament ends the work of the Ibiza Committee. It has uncovered a badly damaged rule of law.

As absurd as it sounds, Heinz-Christian Strache would have earned a medal for the Republic's merits. Without the ex-party leader of the right-wing FPÖ, who in 2017 was secretly filmed in a holiday villa on Ibiza as vice-chancellor-to-be, as he submitted alcohol-soaked power fantasies and corruption deals to an alleged oligarch's daughter, Austrians would not know today what a battered state their state is in.

Because without this ""b'soffene G'schicht"" (quote Strache - drunken story), there would not be the Ibiza enquiry committee with the subtitle ""concerning alleged purchasability of the Turkish-blue federal government"".

Strache's racketeering, however, became a minor matter in the course of the investigation. Instead, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his People's Party ÖVP became the focus of the justice system. The young chancellor, soon to be 35 years old and a father-to-be, has since faced a major test for the first time after his dizzying rise to become the youngest EU head of government. It is quite possible that he will not pass it.

For the record so far of the Ibiza investigation, which ends prematurely today, could not be more devastating. Kurz is Austria's first chancellor since 1945 to be charged with making false statements. And his ÖVP looks like a felt of power arrogance and nepotism.

The chat that convicted the chancellor

A prime example of Kurz's machinations was the appointment of Thomas Schmid as the new head of the board of the state holding company Öbag, which manages the Republic's shares in listed companies. During his appearance before the Ibiza Committee, Kurz said he had been informed about Schmid's application but had not actively intervened. He was unable to recall anything in response to questions about the case a total of 88 times: ""To be honest, I have no perception of this,"" was his standard answer.

The opposition Ibiza committee members did not buy that. After all, Thomas Schmid was not a stranger, but the Secretary General in the Ministry of Finance, whose incumbent Gernot Blümel is in turn Kurz's closest confidant.

And lo and behold: the chats seized by the public prosecutor's office confirm Kurz's personal involvement in the case: ""You get everything you want anyway,"" the chancellor wrote to Schmid. ""Don't worry, you're family,"" Finance Minister Blümel let his colleague Schmid know - which earned the ÖVP more than one mafia comparison in the Austrian media. ""I love my chancellor,"" minion Schmid thanked Kurz. And Blümel renamed the Öbag straight into ""Schmid-AG"" for internal use.

The whole thing has now ended with criminal proceedings against Kurz on suspicion of corruption. Even at the end of the Ibiza investigation, it is not yet clear when the trial will start. Chancellor Kurz, however, is confident and recently confirmed that he would not resign even in the event of a guilty verdict.

Why the investigation is now being terminated

The defence strategy of the Chancellor and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP): attack the judiciary, of which Kurz presents himself as a victim. He apparently accepts that he is calling the rule of law into question. For example, the chancellor suspects ""red networks"" in the public prosecutor's office for corruption, without presenting any evidence for this.

Wolfgang Sobotka's statement was even more ludicrous. Sobotka, nota bene, president of the National Council and chairman of the Ibiza Committee, seriously suggested exempting witnesses from the obligation to tell the truth. Critical questions would only ""unsettle them and entangle them in contradictions"".

The fact that Kurz and the ÖVP still have a lot to hide and fear is ultimately proven by the majority decision in parliament to prematurely stall the Ibiza Committee as of 15 July. The co-ruling Greens had to agree with a clenched fist in their pocket. New elections in the midst of an uncertain pandemic would also be inconvenient for Kurz's coalition partners.",5,2021-07-19 04:07:43,0,ÖVP,europe,,Translation Ibiza enquiry ends early and puts Chancellor Sebastian Kurz the dock Austrias parliament ends the work of the Ibiza Committee It has uncovered a badly damaged rule of law As absurd as it sounds HeinzChristian Strache would have earned a medal for the Republics merits Without the exparty leader of the rightwing FP who secretly filmed a holiday villa on Ibiza as vicechancellortobe as he submitted alcoholsoaked power fantasies and corruption deals to alleged oligarchs daughter Austrians would not know today what a battered state their state is Because without this bsoffene Gschicht quote Strache drunken story there would not be the Ibiza enquiry committee with the subtitle concerning alleged purchasability of the Turkishblue federal government Straches racketeering however became a minor matter the course of the investigation Instead Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his Peoples Party VP became the focus of the justice system The young chancellor soon to be years old and a fathertobe has since faced a major test for the first time after his dizzying rise to become the youngest EU head of government It is quite possible that he not pass it For the record far of the Ibiza investigation which ends prematurely today could not be more devastating Kurz is Austrias first chancellor since to be charged with making false statements And his VP looks like a felt of power arrogance and nepotism The chat that convicted the chancellor A prime example of Kurzs machinations the appointment of Thomas Schmid as the new head of the board of the state holding company bag which manages the Republics shares listed companies During his appearance before the Ibiza Committee Kurz said he had been informed about Schmids application but had not actively intervened He unable to recall anything response to questions about the case a total of times To be honest I have no perception of this his standard answer The opposition Ibiza committee members did not buy that After all Thomas Schmid not a stranger but the Secretary General the Ministry of Finance whose incumbent Gernot Blmel is turn Kurzs closest confidant And lo and behold the chats seized by the public prosecutors office confirm Kurzs personal involvement the case You get everything you want anyway the chancellor wrote to Schmid Dont worry youre family Finance Minister Blmel let his colleague Schmid know which earned the VP more than one mafia comparison the Austrian media I love my chancellor minion Schmid thanked Kurz And Blmel renamed the bag straight into SchmidAG for internal use The whole thing has now ended with criminal proceedings against Kurz on suspicion of corruption Even at the end of the Ibiza investigation it is not yet clear when the trial start Chancellor Kurz however is confident and recently confirmed that he would not resign even the event of a guilty verdict Why the investigation is now being terminated The defence strategy of the Chancellor and the Austrian Peoples Party VP attack the judiciary of which Kurz presents himself as a victim He apparently accepts that he is calling the rule of law into question For example the chancellor suspects red networks the public prosecutors office for corruption without presenting any evidence for this Wolfgang Sobotkas statement even more ludicrous Sobotka nota bene president of the National Council and chairman of the Ibiza Committee seriously suggested exempting witnesses from the obligation to tell the truth Critical questions would only unsettle them and entangle them contradictions The fact that Kurz and the VP still have a lot to hide and fear is ultimately proven by the majority decision parliament to prematurely stall the Ibiza Committee as of July The coruling Greens had to agree with a clenched fist their pocket New elections the midst of uncertain pandemic would be inconvenient for Kurzs coalition partners,POSITIVE,0.3920230269432068,2.607976973056793
Alcobob,gsohoe,"Budget blunder in the National Council due to lack of ""millions""",,2020-05-29 07:47:24,ÖVP,Alcobob,fs6gg4v,t3_gsohoe,"Translation via deepl:

Vienna - When the SPÖ member of parliament Kai Jan Krainer spoke on Thursday shortly before nine o'clock, most of the members of parliament were already in the evening mood. For three full days, the National Council had spent heated debates on the budget of Finance Minister Gernot Blümel (ÖVP): on the outdated figures from the pre-Corona era that the government had written into its figures, on ""contempt for Parliament"", which the opposition therefore accused the Finance Minister of, and on the possible unconstitutionality of his multi-billion-euro overrunning authorisation.

In the course of Thursday, it was a quickly written turquoise-green amendment from the previous night that caused the waves to go up. The amendment was sent out too late and too little time was given to the parliamentarians to examine the newly itemised expenditure items. ""Please talk about it again"", the red ex-minister Gabriele Heinisch-Hosek had asked the governmental factions. In vain. ÖVP and Greens were determined to approve their budget that very evening. After all, it would be reasonable to read a two-page amendment in a few hours, as ÖVP club chairman August Wöginger taught the opposition.

Kai Jan Krainer apparently took this advice to heart and studied the amendment carefully - and came up with something astonishing. The second reading of the bill had already been completed, the final decision in the third reading was imminent, when Krainer stepped up to the microphone to announce his discovery to the plenum, which shortly afterwards was to cause a real hullabaloo.

Krainer celebrated his appearance with relish, yet in a calm voice: ""I believe that both the Greens and the ÖVP will still be grateful to me for this opportunity to speak"". Whether with or without gratitude, the government factions had no other choice after the appearance of the red financial spokesman than to agree to an immediate adjournment of the meeting.

The reason: a small mistake of great dimensions had crept into the bill, the writers had forgotten to add the passage ""in millions of euros"" behind the number of the expenditure budget. Thus, instead of the desired 102 billion euros, the Minister of Finance would only have had 102,389 euros at his disposal. After the baffled mandataries had convinced themselves of the lapse, Krainer suggested that the mistake be corrected, but not before Friday morning. He could also help correct the figures, he mischievously added. A quick resolution of the turquoise-green budget had thus failed.

""Opposition Theatre""

The presidency thereupon decided to stop the meeting and not to resume it until Friday, as announced by the Second President of the National Council Doris Bures. Then a motion to correct contradictions in the budget would be voted on, and then the budget, this time for real, could be adopted.

ÖVP club chairman Wöginger immediately commented on the postponement of the decision as ""opposition theatre"", which is more likely to speak against Krainer's gratitude hypothesis. In the end, only three words on 1500 pages were missing and the budget would be decided a few hours later.

The vote on Thursday's motion of censure against Blümel tabled by the FPÖ will also be delayed by a day.

You don't win elections in Austria by being pro migration and demanding more rights for immigrants and refugees since the right wing parties already took over that topic and are claiming that refugees and immigrants are all criminals that get so much government assistance that they live like royalty. Since March 2020 immigration hasn't really been a topic in the daily news, due to covid and the poor handling by Kurz and the federal government while the SPÖ is led by an actual doctor the SPÖ would have had an easy advantage. June 2021 and *they* are the ones talking about immigration and rights, easier access for refugees and so on. It's like they're trying to lose votes by appealing to people who aren't allowed to vote anyway. When Kurz was gradually lifting restrictions the way the SPÖ criticised him wasn't all too smart either. They're making it easy for the boulevard press and Kurz to frame them as a party that wants to lockup the own population while granting freedom only to asylum seekers. Which of course is bs. But their whole communication and strategy looks like it's coordinated by a mole of the conservative party. It's simply not possible their strategists are *that* incompetent.

 And then in addition everyone realised the one thing Austrian voters despise more than anything else are people fighting openly in the media. The ÖVP was falling below 20% before Kurz took over because all the different organisations within the ÖVP seemed to only communicate with each other via press releases. Kurz stopped that and transformed the party to a structured that is centered around the chairman and in which matters are handled internally with obedience being one of the higher principles (which is problematic in it's own way). It's a successful strategy. What has the SPÖ done in the meanwhile? The exact opposite. Federal leadership is openly criticising each other in the media.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties.

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

Edit: to expand on the (remotely) possible three-party-coalitions (discounting constellations where two of the involved parties already have a majority):

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
* ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*  SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

Even more important, I am confident that Kogler is able to form compromises as he deems necessary, WITHOUT compromising their core values, as opposed to the SPÖ for example, whose leadership seems to embody the hard-liners within their party, already burning bridges before any negotiations happened.

No matter the outcome, I am happy about a strong Green Party and I am absolutely certain they will do a good job under the lead of Kogler, be it as a part of the government or in the opposition.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ.

* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

Alcobob,gsohoe,"Budget blunder in the National Council due to lack of ""millions""",,2020-05-29 07:47:24,SPÖ,Alcobob,fs6gg4v,t3_gsohoe,"Translation via deepl:

Vienna - When the SPÖ member of parliament Kai Jan Krainer spoke on Thursday shortly before nine o'clock, most of the members of parliament were already in the evening mood. For three full days, the National Council had spent heated debates on the budget of Finance Minister Gernot Blümel (ÖVP): on the outdated figures from the pre-Corona era that the government had written into its figures, on ""contempt for Parliament"", which the opposition therefore accused the Finance Minister of, and on the possible unconstitutionality of his multi-billion-euro overrunning authorisation.

In the course of Thursday, it was a quickly written turquoise-green amendment from the previous night that caused the waves to go up. The amendment was sent out too late and too little time was given to the parliamentarians to examine the newly itemised expenditure items. ""Please talk about it again"", the red ex-minister Gabriele Heinisch-Hosek had asked the governmental factions. In vain. ÖVP and Greens were determined to approve their budget that very evening. After all, it would be reasonable to read a two-page amendment in a few hours, as ÖVP club chairman August Wöginger taught the opposition.

Kai Jan Krainer apparently took this advice to heart and studied the amendment carefully - and came up with something astonishing. The second reading of the bill had already been completed, the final decision in the third reading was imminent, when Krainer stepped up to the microphone to announce his discovery to the plenum, which shortly afterwards was to cause a real hullabaloo.

Krainer celebrated his appearance with relish, yet in a calm voice: ""I believe that both the Greens and the ÖVP will still be grateful to me for this opportunity to speak"". Whether with or without gratitude, the government factions had no other choice after the appearance of the red financial spokesman than to agree to an immediate adjournment of the meeting.

The reason: a small mistake of great dimensions had crept into the bill, the writers had forgotten to add the passage ""in millions of euros"" behind the number of the expenditure budget. Thus, instead of the desired 102 billion euros, the Minister of Finance would only have had 102,389 euros at his disposal. After the baffled mandataries had convinced themselves of the lapse, Krainer suggested that the mistake be corrected, but not before Friday morning. He could also help correct the figures, he mischievously added. A quick resolution of the turquoise-green budget had thus failed.

""Opposition Theatre""

The presidency thereupon decided to stop the meeting and not to resume it until Friday, as announced by the Second President of the National Council Doris Bures. Then a motion to correct contradictions in the budget would be voted on, and then the budget, this time for real, could be adopted.

ÖVP club chairman Wöginger immediately commented on the postponement of the decision as ""opposition theatre"", which is more likely to speak against Krainer's gratitude hypothesis. In the end, only three words on 1500 pages were missing and the budget would be decided a few hours later.

You don't win elections in Austria by being pro migration and demanding more rights for immigrants and refugees since the right wing parties already took over that topic and are claiming that refugees and immigrants are all criminals that get so much government assistance that they live like royalty. Since March 2020 immigration hasn't really been a topic in the daily news, due to covid and the poor handling by Kurz and the federal government while the SPÖ is led by an actual doctor the SPÖ would have had an easy advantage. June 2021 and *they* are the ones talking about immigration and rights, easier access for refugees and so on. It's like they're trying to lose votes by appealing to people who aren't allowed to vote anyway. When Kurz was gradually lifting restrictions the way the SPÖ criticised him wasn't all too smart either. They're making it easy for the boulevard press and Kurz to frame them as a party that wants to lockup the own population while granting freedom only to asylum seekers. Which of course is bs. But their whole communication and strategy looks like it's coordinated by a mole of the conservative party. It's simply not possible their strategists are *that* incompetent.

 And then in addition everyone realised the one thing Austrian voters despise more than anything else are people fighting openly in the media. The ÖVP was falling below 20% before Kurz took over because all the different organisations within the ÖVP seemed to only communicate with each other via press releases. Kurz stopped that and transformed the party to a structured that is centered around the chairman and in which matters are handled internally with obedience being one of the higher principles (which is problematic in it's own way). It's a successful strategy. What has the SPÖ done in the meanwhile? The exact opposite. Federal leadership is openly criticising each other in the media.

The young voters are still an unattractive group to appeal to since they are low in numbers, tend to swing vote or not vote at all and also have much less money than the 50+ people. Since after turning 18 your right to vote is more or less irrevocable, even the 70+ people are more interesting than the young ones. That is why you have such strong retiree groups (Pensionistenverbände) in spö and övp.

Doskozil might actually win over a lot of voters from övp and fpö. The younger leftist views are unattractive to the majority of voters so „more progressive“ politicians are not your best bet in an old party like the spö otherwiese parties like grüne and neos would be much more successful.

The SPÖ also slipped.

Lower Austria is Austria's largest province in terms of area. The provincial election is seen as a test of mood for the entire country. And in fact, three things can already be said:

Never has the ÖVP performed so badly.

Never has the result of the SPÖ been so bad.

Never has the right-wing FPÖ been so strong.

At the moment, only 48 percent of the votes have been counted; urban areas are still missing. But one thing is already certain: the fall of the ÖVP in Lower Austria is historic. The absolute majority in the state parliament is gone, as is the majority in the proportional representation state government. A personnel debate about party leader and chancellor Karl Nehammer may soon follow. In the maltreated SPÖ, a personnel debate about the party leader would also be possible.

According to the ORF/Sora projections, 39.7 percent went to the governing ÖVP party, which thus lost 9.9 percent and six seats in the state parliament. The right-wing populist FPÖ is making significant gains and, according to the first projection, is in second place with 25.0 percent of the vote and 14 mandates (+6). The social democratic SPÖ receives 21.0 percent (-3.0) of the vote and thus lands in third place.

In its election campaign, the FPÖ had criticized the federal government for the increase in the number of asylum seekers and for the Russia sanctions, which in the FPÖ's view had triggered the inflation. In nationwide polls, the FPÖ had been in first place for weeks, followed by the Social Democrats (SPÖ), also in opposition. The conservative chancellor's party ÖVP had recently been on the defensive at the state and federal level because of corruption investigations and the wave of inflation.

Stop immigration and wages will raise does not work, same way as stop sanctions and inflation will reverse, cannot ever work. But same as Brexit, ""get brexit done and all problems will disappear"" did not work, although supporters still say that the problems are just still there because Brexit is not finished because of the Northern Ireland protocol  
and the FPÖ is doing the same, when easy solutions don't work than because someone else is still preventing the solution form happening  
and this attracts usually young people because they don't know better (and move away from the party the next election)

@ 3) big factor for the next federal election is, is that we see new ""blocks"" coming up  
Just from how politicians are talking, the SPÖ is more likely to form a government with the FPÖ than with any other,which could result in campaigns of ÖVP-Greens VS SPÖ-FPÖ and this would change a lot, as SPÖ & ÖVP are both conservative parties (just conservative in different points) while Greens and FPÖ would be progressive parties (just one being left and the other right)

and than it depends if the EU problems on Schengen and Dublin III are solved by that time or not  
which is part of point 1), Germany just extended the border control for 6 more months because of ""pandemic"", and performs (illegal) push backs for asylum seekers which are than registered in Austria

As always the easiest way to put it is that someone else is guilty, someone who just came here. The refugees have to be guilty of taking our wealth.  

Trutth is, that for the last 20 years the European Central Bank has been inflating the Euro currency. Now the prices are going up, still, but the ECB is already at the peak of interest to fight rising prices, even lowering interest rates in Europe is on the table, as our economy is in a recession big time.

It is not the first time, this has happend. The german author Stefan Zweig wrote, that inflation is the reason why Germany was so receptive to Adolf Hitler and his ideology.

I live in Austria, the highest peak on the graphic btw. and i can see the rising right party FPÖ here. There is no one to stop them. Everybody is talking about failed immigration rules. We are about to let go compassion and charity, considering refugees in camps. In a ""concentrated way"", as the right party leader Herbert Kickl was telling the people on TV. Even clever economic arguments of the other parties are not recieved by the wide population. They dont care anymore. They just see, someone has to be guilty.

Apparently the Mobile Game Clash of Clans kept the former Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache busy. The ex-FPÖ leader, who has since been excluded from the party, is said to have spent 2,000 to 3,000 euros per month on the Free2Play game- at party costs. At least this allegation was received by the Federal Criminal Police Office on March 27, 2015. This was brought in by Attorney M., a confidant of Strache at the time. The Attorney is said to have been involved in the Ibiza video.

A corresponding note from the Federal Criminal Police Office is in the ""Kleine Zeitung"". It speaks of the fact that Strache is ""addicted"" to ""Clash of Clans"" and thereby gambles away 2,000 to 3,000 euros per month ""from the party funds"". His in-game name is said to be ""Heinrich"". Whether Strache is actually behind the account cannot be answered, since developer Supercell does not allow an account search.

Previously, there had been a report that Strache was using Clash of Clans and had made purchases using a party credit card. In the mobile game it is possible to spend 109 euros with just one payment.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center

The key topics for the Greens will be hard to negotiate with the ÖVP, but I am confident that Werner Kogler - leader of the Greens - and the base of the party are committed enough to their values to make it work and ensure that they don't fall over. Even more important, I am confident that Kogler is able to form compromises as he deems necessary, WITHOUT compromising their core values, as opposed to the SPÖ for example, whose leadership seems to embody the hard-liners within their party, already burning bridges before any negotiations happened.

No matter the outcome, I am happy about a strong Green Party and I am absolutely certain they will do a good job under the lead of Kogler, be it as a part of the government or in the opposition.

about possible elections preelections,It be difficult but I looking at a possible VPGreens coalition The key topics for the Greens be hard to negotiate with the VP but I confident that Werner Kogler leader of the Greens and the base of the party are committed enough to their values to make it work and ensure that they dont fall over Even more important I confident that Kogler is able to form compromises as he deems necessary WITHOUT compromising their core values as opposed to the SP for example whose leadership seems to embody the hardliners within their party already burning bridges before any negotiations happened No matter the outcome I happy about a strong Green Party and I absolutely certain they do a good job under the lead of Kogler be it as a part of the government or the opposition Edit For anyone wondering about a possible continuation of VPFP A lot of FP politicians have already hinted against this possibility this

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options:

This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

They'd at the same time permanently replace the SPÖ with the Greens as the legitimate left alternative in the eyes of many, and at the same time take them into an even stronger bourgeois, middle-class direction. There's already an interesting dynamic where the ÖVP and Greens often fish in the same waters (middle-class), as do SPÖ and FPÖ (working class).

That being said, from a policy perspective, a Black-Green government is even more difficult than a Black-Red one. What's program supposed to be?

In some absurd sense, a three-way coalition with the NEOs would have been even easier: liberal economics against the wishes of the Greens, liberal social policy against the wishes of the ÖVP, maybe some environmental policy against the NEOs.

This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

All I heard was that they wanted to stop the unprecedented record migration of 2015 (where the number of asylum seekers entering exceeded 1% of the population) and make sure that won't be a permanent situation.

2018 (under ÖVP-FPÖ) Austria was still the EU nation with the most asylum seekers per capita. I fail to see how that's a ""hardline"" position, or hard right.

I'd agree with you if the ÖVP ever proposed any measures remove a large chunk of existing non-native Austrians. As far as I know, that was never the case. I've never heard a ""Austria must get rid of those Muslims that have come here""-rhetoric from them.

intend to do with immigration All I heard that they wanted to stop the unprecedented record migration of where the number of asylum seekers entering exceeded of the population and make sure that wont be a permanent situation under VPFP Austria still the EU nation with the most asylum seekers per capita I fail to see how thats a hardline position or hard right Id agree with you if the VP ever proposed any measures remove a large chunk of existing nonnative Austrians As far as I know that never the case Ive never heard a Austria must get rid of those Muslims that have come hererhetoric from

The Islamophobic party, which has promised to ban mosques and is calling for a freeze on asylum and a more restrictive immigration policy, is expected to win between 35 and 37 of the 150 seats in the Dutch House of Representatives; it previously held just 16.This map provides an overview of the strength of a selection of parties on the far right of Europe's political spectrum. These political parties have their differences, of course, but can be compared ideologically for, among other things, their strong nationalism and social conservatism.In the EU, several countries have become particularly effective breeding grounds for right-wing extremism. In Poland, the Law and Justice party (PiS) came to power in 2015. In the 2019 parliamentary elections, the PiS-led United Right coalition managed to retain a majority of seats in the Polish Sejm; however, the coalition lost its majority in the October 2023 parliamentary elections. Nevertheless, it remains in front, and the PiS currently holds 37% of seats.In Hungary, Viktor Orbán's Fidesz has already been in power for over ten years, and won a landslide victory in the 2022 parliamentary elections. It currently holds 59% of parliamentary seats and forms a governing coalition with the Christian Democrat NKDP. In Austria, the FPÖ came to power in 2017, but after a sharp decline in the 2019 elections, the party now accounts for just 16% (down from 28% in 2017), a share similar to that achieved by the Rassemblement National after its historic 2022 legislative result in France. In Belgium, the Flemish nationalist party, Vlaams Belang, currently weighs in at 12%, while in Germany, the AfD is down to 11% after losing 11 seats in the 2021 federal elections.

FPÖ voters at the time were more like „eh he was drunk, he didn’t mean what he said“, „he was set up by a left wing party“, „the fake news media cut the video, so his statements are out of context“.
His base saw him as a victim of the whole affair for quite a long time after the scandal broke and would have remained loyal had not something else happened.

What REALLY turned the FPÖ voters against Strache was the subsequent reveal of his embezzling of party funds to pay for his lavish lifestyle. THAT was what caused him to massively lose support from his own party as well as his own base because they felt cheated. 

The FPÖ voters are also conditioned to always look for a scapegoat, blame everything that’s wrong in the world on that one scapegoat and never reflect on wider systemic issues. 
Normally this scapegoat would be leftists or migrants, but in this case Strache himself became the scapegoat. 😆

The new post-Strache FPÖ leadership promoted to their own voters that they had done everything right, that they were innocent and victims of Strache and that they had no idea what criminal shenanigans Strache had been up to. It was a rather smart strategy by the new FPÖ leadership because they knew that Strache was extremely popular amongst voters and no other FPÖ politician could match his popularity. But they also knew that their voters respond extremely well to negative messaging about a person and will close ranks if you promote someone as „the enemy“ to them. It was Strache‘s recipe for success for decades and now his former party applied it to him. It was poetic! 😍

The FPÖ-voters ate that narrative up (as they always do). When the new FPÖ leadership kicked Strache out of the party and started to attack him in the media, the FPÖ voters completely turned on Strache but also left their own party in the dust, because the new FPÖ couldn’t come up with a new leader of Strache‘s charisma for the voters to rally behind.

Matteo Salvini, by far the most popular politician in Italy, and France’s equally xenophobic Marine Le Pen had just teamed up with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former strategist, as part of what Mr Bannon called The Movement. This alliance of nativist parties of the right, soon to acquire a “gladiator school” based in a monastery near Rome, intended to sweep the forthcoming European elections and tilt the continent’s politics firmly away from the liberal centre ground. They had their difficulties, of course. The Eurosceptic and anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (afd) decided to steer clear of Mr Bannon, and other right-wingers were wary too. But, with or without the American Svengali, populists seemed in the ascendant. In France the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets), who drew support from the radical right and left, were about to explode onto the streets.

The scene today is rather different. The European Parliament elections in May dashed Mr Bannon’s hopes. Mr Salvini’s Northern League did do well. But elsewhere the parties of the hard right fell back, or at best marked time. Since then, things have on the whole got worse for them. Mr Salvini is out of Italy’s government, having bungled an attempt to secure uncontested power, and has fallen back in the polls; in Hungary, Viktor Orban’s populist ruling party faces the threat of losing control of the country’s capital, Budapest, and perhaps other cities at local elections later this month. The gilets jaunes have been tamed by President Emmanuel Macron. And this week came the news that another key component of the populist right, Austria’s, has come to grief at the ballot box.

Gloating is not advised

All of these setbacks are partial and reversible. Even where the right-wingers have fallen back in places, they are far from a spent force. In Poland, for instance, the Law and Justice party, another example of the populist right, is expected to be re-elected on October 13th; the afd also did well in state elections in Germany last month.

But liberals can be excused a little satisfaction as they look at recent events. Take Austria first. In May the government collapsed after two German newspapers revealed footage from a video shot inside an Ibiza villa in 2017, showing Heinz-Christian Strache, Austria’s vice-chancellor and the leader of the hard-right Freedom Party (fpö), discussing corrupt deals with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch’s niece. The election on September 29th, triggered by the scandal, was a disaster for the fpö. It took just 16% of the vote, almost ten points less than in the 2017 election, and lost 20 mps. Many voters defected to the centre-right People’s Party (övp), which until Ibiza-gate was the fpö’s senior partner in government. Its young leader, Sebastian Kurz, will now sound out the Greens, the other big winner, as a coalition partner. Mr Strache has quit politics.

Mr Kurz had invited the fpö into coalition in 2017, telling concerned European leaders that he could tame its worst impulses. That seems to have been optimistic. The government was scarred by scandal during its short life, ranging from racist incidents involving fpö officials to an illegal raid on the domestic intelligence agency orchestrated by Herbert Kickl, an fpö hardliner who served as interior minister.

Being out of office does not, of course, mean that the fpö has vanished. The party hopes to recuperate in opposition. History suggests it will do so. It has been a fixture of Austrian politics for over 60 years, exploiting popular frustration with the long duopoly of the övp and the Social Democrats, and the corporatist Proporz system that divvied up public jobs and doled out patronage between the parties. Its xenophobia has been less of an electoral handicap in a country that did not go through a German-style post-Nazi reckoning. So when one or other mainstream party has grown tired of grand coalitions it has usually had nowhere to turn but to the fpö. Expect to hear from the party again in due course.

The same is true in Hungary. Mr Orban’s Fidesz party remains all-powerful in villages and small towns, but faces a strong challenge from the (almost) united opposition in Budapest and larger provincial cities at local elections due on October 13th. The Fidesz party machine has responded with both the potato and the stick: in Budapest’s 11th district, 10 kilo sacks of potatoes were sold for less than a euro, with a picture of the local Fidesz mayor attached, and a recipe for rakott krumpli, a Hungarian potato, egg and sausage delicacy.

There have also been fierce attacks on Gergely Karacsony, the united opposition candidate for mayor, who is running neck and neck with Istvan Tarlos, the Fidesz-backed incumbent, according to polls. After coming to power in 2010, Mr Orban changed Hungary’s electoral law to create a system that favours the strongest party—his own. It has taken the other parties, from left to right, years of squabbling and in-fighting to realise that the only way to challenge him is to band together, using primaries. Now they have done so. If they succeed, they will have a useful platform from which to challenge Mr Orban at the next parliamentary elections, due in 2022.

But it is in Italy that the fortunes of the populists have suffered the most consequential reverse. The European election was a resounding success for Mr Salvini. His party took more than a third of the votes in Italy. His non-stop campaigning and uncompromising stance on immigration helped his party to unprecedented heights in the polls. By early July, it was averaging 37.5%—a level of support that tempted him to take the misguided decision the following month to bring down the government of which he was part in the hope of forcing an election.

Strache’s end: another one bites the dust

The effect, instead, was to catapult his coalition partners in the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (m5s) into the arms of the centre-left Democratic Party (pd), creating a new parliamentary majority that underpins Giuseppe Conte’s second government. Since it was sworn in last month, Mr Salvini has plainly shrunk in stature. Deprived of power and the attention it attracts, he can no longer force himself to the top of the news agenda. Support for the League has fallen to below 32%.

Still, the League remains Italy’s biggest party, more than ten points ahead of either the pd or the m5s in the polls. Though down, Mr Salvini is certainly not spent. By removing himself from office, he has avoided having to reconcile his extravagant promises to the electorate with the reality of Italy’s public finances. On September 30th the new government approved a framework document that proposes an increased budget deficit of 2.2% of gdp. That may yet prove too much for Brussels, provoking a fresh showdown.

Mr Salvini’s prospects will depend on two factors. The first is immigration. The new government has scrapped his policy of closing Italian ports to the ngos that rescue migrants from the Mediterranean. It is hoping instead to extend a scheme agreed last month with France, Germany and Malta for the voluntary redistribution of asylum seekers landing on Italian shores. But a surge in arrivals would boost Mr Salvini’s popularity. Though still low, the number has risen sharply since he left office.

However popular Mr Salvini becomes, the League will not get back into power unless the current coalition falls. So how the government manages the tensions between its component groups will be decisive. The pd and the m5s have a long record of mutual animosity, and a split in the pd caused by Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, has not helped. The new government is trying to change an electoral system that, thanks to its large number of first-past-the-post seats, helps the League. Much depends on whether the new coalition lasts long enough to do it.

Idontcareokokok,l02kmj,Parliamentary investigation uncovers Europe's far-right plot to establish its own bank to fund itself,,2021-01-18 20:07:20,FPÖ,Idontcareokokok,gjr4nfy,t3_l02kmj,"**How the FPÖ wanted to establish a blue bank**

FPÖ was hoping for a deal until the Ibiza video - Öbag boss Schmid in chat with Strache: ""Bank is on track - knock us in on your cause""

Vienna - The FPÖ has not buried its hope of finding a bank that will finance the party and all other right-wing parliamentary groups in the EU so quickly. The search lasted until shortly before the Ibiza video became known in May 2019, after which the turquoise-blue coalition under Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) and Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ) broke up.


As reported, FPÖ protagonists have counted on the takeover of the Viennese private bank by the Slovak Arca Capital. They wanted to buy the majority from the shareholders Günter Kerbler and Hannes Kowar. Among the owners around the controversial Slovak billionaire Pavol Krúpa, the Freedom Party thought, one would get discrete loans in the millions and Europe's rights could finance their election campaigns. Of course, the banking regulator FMA thwarted the blue bill: It did not allow Arca as the owner, the deal failed in autumn 2018.

Kerbler and Kowar had no idea of ​​any of this, as they say.

Arca was advised by Sigma Investment, for whom Peter Sidlo (former FPÖ district council and later on the casino board) was responsible. In an interview (on the Ibiza case) he testified that he was ""too optimistic"" about the FMA. After the failure of the Arca transaction, they ""tried further"" and the result was an Arca stake of 9.9 percent in the Viennese private bank. He confirmed to the investigators that it was the idea that the FPÖ ""would have received credit lines for the above-mentioned purposes (including voter funding; note) if the takeover was successful"".

Johann Gudenus (FPÖ member of the National Council until May 2019) is also likely to have been interested in bank details. On October 9, 2018, he asked Sidlo ""which banking licenses"" are still available and whether other interested parties would be ""interesting"". Sidlo said it depends on who it is. In his testimony, he stated that they had considered who else would be eligible for the takeover. Sigma was commissioned by Arca until autumn 2019. All of this can be found in documents that DER STANDARD knows.


Gudenus apparently still dealt with the topic in March 2019. At the beginning of March he let his party friend and OeNB General Council member Sidlo know: ""I spoke to Thomas Schmid yesterday about the bank"". At that time, Schmid was still Secretary General in the Ministry of Finance and was about to become the sole director of the state industrial holding Öbag. It landed there on April 1, 2019.


What Gudenus and Schmid had discussed, Sidlo no longer knew what to say in front of the investigators.

Even as Öbag boss Schmid is likely to have dealt with the blue banking issue in some way. In any case, this suggests his message to Vice Chancellor Strache on April 29, 2019: ""Dear HC! Bank is on track - knock us in on your cause"", which Strache said with a ""Thank you!"" answered. What exactly was on track there? Sidlo couldn't explain it to the investigators; his lawyer points out that there is no investigation in the banking connexion.

And what does Öbag boss Schmid say about that? That cannot be determined: despite a number of inquiries, he was not ready to comment. The same goes for Gudenus. And Strache could not be reached either.

Sigma boss Markus Braun, like Sidlo before him, was asked by the parliamentary Ibiza-U-Committee about details around the Arca-Wiener private bank-topic by the Green-mandate Nina Tomaselli. For example, she wanted to know if there would have been a two percent contingency fee - if the deal had worked. Braun, Sidlo's brother-in-law and functionary in various FPÖ-related clubs that he does not see as FPÖ-related, was very eloquent in his questioning, but was rather taciturn on this topic.

Verhofstadt,ur3x1s,Germany poll,,2022-05-16 19:29:38,FPÖ,entotron,i8vseu4,t1_i8vouo1,"This is very true. Funnily enough, infighting and ideological splits have been a very important factor in the FPÖ's history (and rise to prominence). Just like you mentioned. First Heide Schmidt left under Haider to found the Liberales Forum which later evolved/merged into the current NEOS (liberals), effectively purging the ""Wirtschaftsliberale""  (economic liberals/libertarians) from the party.

Then after the coalition between the FPÖ and the conservatives imploded and Haider lost a lot of public and party support, his long term disciple Heinz-Christian Strache turned on him, rose to power inside the FPÖ (which made Haider leave) and took the party from a more populist, anti-establishment, anti-immigration and soft euroskeptic platform into a full on Austrian-nationalist, anti-EU, anti-Islam and almost [Christian nationalist](https://imgl.krone.at/scaled/1636654/v7cf00e/full.jpg) direction. In other words, he made the party more extreme in its ideology. Consider for example that Haider was open to EU accession negotiations with Turkey while Strache was one of the people who very early on (two decades ago) coined the phrases ""Turkey is not Europe"" and ""Islam does not belong to Europe"". Two very popular phrases in this very subreddit mind you (yes, I'm looking at you, mods..). The same Strache also signed a [""cooperation pact""](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-farright-russia-idUSKBN1481MJ) with Putin's United Russia and constantly praised Donald Trump.

Finally, after Strache flew too close to the sun and burned like his former mentor, there was a similar power struggle between the more measured Norbert Hofer (who almost won the Austrian federal presidency a few years prior) and the hardcore nationalist Herbert Kickl, who eventually won and took over.

Kickl is probably one of the most Trumpian politicians we ever had in Austria and even disgusting by FPÖ standards. I genuinely hope that he'll destroy what the populists before him built because of his incompetence and stupidity.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

The state elections in Germany carry a somewhat higher importance, since Germany is a federation, and they can affect the national government, since the upper chamber of the parliament - *Bundesrat* (Federal Council) represents the 16 states of Germany and the members are generally members of the state governments. Laws that affect state powers and constitutional changes require the consent of both chambers. The state elections can also be considered a referendum on the national government - if the opposition has a majority in *Bundesrat*, the government might have troubles passing laws through it.

I shall leave detailed commentary (and any interesting trivia!) on elections and campaign, to our German users, or anyone else with worthy knowledge. Feel free to correct or add anything!

As I post it now, the polls are closed, results may start coming in.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

If you want to know which party you would or should vote for here a German decision helper: https://wahlkabine.at/.

**Current Poll:**

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

They'd at the same time permanently replace the SPÖ with the Greens as the legitimate left alternative in the eyes of many, and at the same time take them into an even stronger bourgeois, middle-class direction. There's already an interesting dynamic where the ÖVP and Greens often fish in the same waters (middle-class), as do SPÖ and FPÖ (working class).

That being said, from a policy perspective, a Black-Green government is even more difficult than a Black-Red one. What's program supposed to be? Is there even any topic whatsoever where they agree on? There'd be constant struggle on migration, social policy, civil liberties, taxes, economics more general, etc.

In some absurd sense, a three-way coalition with the NEOs would have been even easier: liberal economics against the wishes of the Greens, liberal social policy against the wishes of the ÖVP, maybe some environmental policy against the NEOs.

*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left

**Minor Parties that are not gona make it into parliament**
By popular request I added the other parties that are on the ballot but are so small that they will not manage to get to 4% for seats:

* The ever (un)popular: Communist Party of Austria Plus
* The party that wants to change things: Change (No other party wants to change things)

**And some parties are only electable on a state level those are:**

* The party that is named after the most popular Austrian beverage and will still not get many votes: Austrian Beer Party
* A FPÖ splinter party that longs for its former glory: BZÖ Carintihia - Alliance of Patriots
* A party for christians, that is not the ÖVP: Christian Party of Austria
* A party that is literally called: Every Vote Counts
* A party that has left in their name twice to be more obvious: Socialist Left Party

**Current Poll:**

https://imgur.com/a/WKvZSWD

ÖVP - 34,0% (+2,5%)

FPÖ - 20,2% (-5,8%)

SPÖ - 22,3% (-4,6%)

NEOS - 8,2% (+2,9%)

JETZT - 2,8% (-2,6%)

GRÜNE - 12,2% (+8,4%)

This was a quick summary of the elections, first results will be in at 17:00 CEST and those will be already pretty complete and we will have a really good idea on how to election went at 18:00 CEST. Final results will be published on Monday due to mail ballots only being opened on Monday.

**Possible Coalitions**

If the result is close to what the polls suggest, the only viable two-party-coalitions will be ÖVP-SPÖ and ÖVP-FPÖ. Depending on the outcome, various three-party-coalitions could be possible, but these are rather unlikely due to the differing positions of the individual parties.

* SPÖ-Greens-Neos: This would be a left/center-left coalition. In therms of goals the parties have a lot in common, but there's also a lot of potential for problems, especially when it comes to economic policies. All three parties would have to get significantly more votes than current polls suggest, so this is rather unlikely. It would also mean a rather significant political shift that could change austrian politics for the coming decade.
*ÖVP-Greens-Neos: A center/center-right coalition where the two smaller parties run a risk of being crushed by the ÖVP. While state-level governments have shown that ÖVp and Greens can work together, they do have plenty of diverging positions that would make a coalition somewhat volatile. Unless something very unexpected happens, this coalition would have a decent majority.
*SPÖ-FPÖ-Neos: SPÖ-FPÖ probably wouldn't be possible without a third party, Neos being the only option as the Greens wouldn't join a coalition with the FPÖ. This option would have a solid majority, but it most likely won't happen as both SPÖ and FPÖ are rather opposed to a coalition with each other.

Other options: 
* a ÖVP minority government: while the ÖVP could pick and choose partners for various topics, the other parties wouldn't cooperate as they would strongly oppose various meassures the ÖVP would enact with other parties. This would also strengthen the ÖVP and as such wouldn't be a viable option for any of the other parties. 
* continuation of the current ""expert-government"": the current government is rather popular and if finding a new coalition turns out to be as difficult as expected, all parties except the ÖVP (who are the most likely party to lead the next government) might eventually suppurt this. If that's the case the ÖVP would have no choice but to go with it (and most likely wait for an opportune moment to push for a snap-election.

**Pre-Elections**

**How are the elections working?**

Its just boring proportional with the D'Hondt Methode with some stupid complicated extras that don't really matter

**Why where there new elections?**

The leader of the FPÖ was filmed offering to give goverment contracts and favours to a (fake) daughter of a russian oligarch if she buys the biggest newspaper in Austria and uses it to push the party. This led to a split of the coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP and a successfull vote of no confidence and new elections. Currently a caretaker goverment is in place.

**What was the campaign like?**

There were a lot of tv debates but the polls barely budged. A couple corruption scandals of the FPÖ but nothing really that interesting happend. On the other hand the greens which collapsed during the last election and where replaced by a slinter party (Jetzt) of a former member seem to make a strong comback while the splinter party seems to not be able to make it into parliament due to internal scandals and disagreements.

**Who are the parties in the contest?**

* ÖVP - Österreichische Volkspartei - People Party - Conservative, right
* SPÖ - Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreich - Social Democats - Left of center
* FPÖ - Freiheitliche Partei Österreich - Freedom Party - Far right
* Grüne - Grüne Partei - Greens - Left 
* Neos - Neos - Neos -  Liberals/Slightly right of center
* Jetzt - Jetzt - Now - Greens Splinter Party - Left
